Steps to deploy a model to WML

1) Either drag and drop or create an SPSS model in Modeler Flows in Watson Studio

2) Right click on the terminal node of the stream that's intended to be used for scoring
and select 'save as scoring branch'

3) Give the model a name and select the appropriate Watson Machine Learning service you'd like
to deploy it too; If you don't have a Watson Machine Learning instance, you can create one in this step

4) Navigate back out to your project in Watson Studio and scroll down to the Models tab

5) You should see the model you just created there, click into it

6) Click Deployments and then on the right side of the screen click '+ Add Deployments' and give the
deployment a name

7) A deployment for the model should get added to the list and the Status column should eventually read
Deployment success

8) In Deployments, click in the model that was just added to the list

9) Take note of the the Deployment ID, Model ID, and Model URL because you may need these later to build the URL
to call the model

10) the final thing you will need to do is get the authentication token for the model; click the implementation tab to get
instruction for how to do this

the instructions from the tab are below for making the cURL request (the username, password, and URL will come from the
separate Watson Machine Learning Service in Bluemix; you will need to navigate there and create the credentials under
service credentials):

# retrieve your $WML_SERVICE_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME, $WML_SERVICE_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD, and $WML_SERVICE_CREDENTIALS_URL from the
# Service credentials associated with your IBM Cloud Watson Machine Learning Service instance.

curl --basic --user $WML_SERVICE_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME:$WML_SERVICE_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD $WML_SERVICE_CREDENTIALS_URL/v3/identity/token

11) You will then need to add the authentication token you get from the curl request to the header of an API call to
the WML model; below is a sample of what can be added to a node-red function node before calling the API

msg.headers =
    {"Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept":"application/json",
    "Authorization":"Bearer <token>"};

12) Here is a link to more info about using the WML API:
https://watson-ml-api.mybluemix.net/#/

13) Here's a sample flow that lists all the deployments for a particular model.  You will just need to update the token
in the 'building WML api call' function and update the url with the right details in the 'Machine Learning' http
request node. NOTE: we are using an HTTP request node here, not a Watson Machine Learning or Predictive Analytics node.
I just gave the node the label of Machine learning in the stream:

14) IBM CTPs have access to standard and professional WML instances as part of our trial versions for IMB Cloud accounts; in the event you exceed your limit for requests and scores for the WML instances you have deployed, check that you have upgraded
your WML instance to standard or professional
